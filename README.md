# Riksdagen Records

This is a working repository for the curation of records (_protokoll_) of the Swedish Riksdag. 

These records are a component of _The Swedish Parliament Corpus_. For an overview of the whole corpus, semantically versioned public releases (incl. data downloads), quality assessment results, and suggestions for how to use the corpus, please see the main releases page -- [here](https://github.com/swerik-project/the-swedish-parliament-corpus).

Read about the SWERIK project and ongoing collaboration on our [website](https://swerik-project.github.io/) and reach out to us with questions or to get involved with the project on the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/swerik-project/discussions) page.
